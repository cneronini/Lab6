Letter Counting Program

This C program counts the occurrences of each letter (A-Z and a-z) in a series of text strings entered by the user. The program provides a distribution of letter counts, treating both uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent and ignoring non-letter characters.

Input:
The program takes input from the user via the keyboard. You will be prompted to enter text strings. To provide input:
1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the text strings you want to analyze. You can input any text you like.
3. To exit and view the letter counts, press Enter on an empty line (i.e., when you don't enter any text and just press the Enter key).

Output:
Once you press Enter on an empty line, the program will display the distribution of letter counts. The output will show the count of each letter (A-Z and a-z) that appeared in the input.
For example, the output may look like this when the word "dog" is entered as an input:
Distribution of letters in the input:
A: 0 B: 0 C: 0 D: 1 E: 0 F: 0 G: 1 H: 0 I: 0 J: 0 K: 0 L: 0 M: 0 N: 0 O: 1 P: 0 Q: 0 R: 0 S: 0 T: 0 U: 0 V: 0 W: 0 X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0
